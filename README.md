  # Employee Tracker (In-Progress)

  ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)
  ## Description

  The employee tracker that you see is the work-in-progress of a program that will give the functionality to display a company's employees, roles, departments, as well as add those options, and then edit them.  At it's current state, you may view the roles, and departments, however displaying employees is not working.  This is a work in progress, so I will be updating the program soon.
